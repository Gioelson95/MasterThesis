\noindent This chapter introduces the readers to Electrodermal Activities and how are they related with Music Emotion Recognition task.

\section{Electrodermal phenomena}
Already in the 80's, psychological factors related to electrodermal phenomena were observed. It became an important field of study, due to the fact its ease of obtaining a distinct electrodermal response (EDR), the intensity of which seems apparently related to stimulus intensity and/or its psychological significance \cite{boucsein2012electrodermal}.
\\ \indent
While there is still widespread disagreement and confusion about the nature and causes of musically evoked emotions, recent studies involving real-time observation of brain activity seem to show that areas of the brain linked with emotion (as well as pleasure and reward) are activated by music listening \cite{trost2012mapping}.

\section{Electrodermal Activity}
Electrodermal Activity (EDA) was first introduced by Johnson and Lubin in 1966 \cite{johnson1996} as a common term for all electrical phenomena in skin, including all active and passive electrical properties that can be traced back to the skin and its appendages.
\\
Electrodermal activity (EDA) is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin. Historically, EDA has also been known as skin conductance, galvanic skin response (GSR), electrodermal response (EDR), psychogalvanic reflex (PGR), skin conductance response (SCR), sympathetic skin response (SSR) and skin conductance level (SCL). The long history of research into the active and passive electrical properties of the skin by a variety of disciplines has resulted in an excess of names, now standardized to electrodermal activity.
\\ \indent
The use of the term \textit{response} for phasic electrodermal phenomena suggests that there is a distinct relationship to a stimulus producing an EDR. Sometimes there are phasic parts that cannot be traced to any specific simulation, they are called \textit{spontaneous} or \textit{non-specific} EDRs.
\\ \indent
There is ample empirical evidence that electrodermal phenomena are generated by sweat gland activity in conjunction with epidermal membrane processes. When sweat gland activity is abolished in humans, either as a result of congenital absence, by sympathectomy, by peripheral sudomotor nerve discharge, or by pharmacological blocking, SCRs and SPRs are normally eliminated and SCL is considerably reduced \cite{fowles1993electrodermal}.
\\ \indent
As mentioned before, skin conductance is characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tonic skin conductance level (SCL): smooth underlying slowly changing level, it accounts for the general levels of the coductivity of the skin.
	\item Phasic skin conductance response (SCR): rapidly changing peaks, results from momentary sympathetic activation when arousing stimuli are present.
\end{itemize}
In the figure \ref{fig:signal_phasic} can be seen an EDA file plot and the division in Tonic and Phasic parts thanks to pyphysio library \cite{bizzego2019pyphysio}.

Another useful graph is shown in the figure \ref{fig:phasic_tonic} from \cite{hernandez2014using} that represent division between the complete signal (in blue), the tonic component (in green-dashed) and the phasic component (in red).

\end{figure}
\\
The time series of the change of Skin Conductance (SC) can be characterized by a slowly varying tonic activity and fast varying phasic activity. The SCRs shows a steep incline to the peak and a slow decline to the basilne. The successions of SCRs usually results in a superposition of subsequent SCRs as one SCR arises on top of the declining trail of the preceding one.
\\
The figure \ref{fig:skin_conductance} from \cite{benedek2010continuous} shows a SC data section of 165 s, the upper row shows the original SC data. The middle row shows the driver signal which results from deconvolution of the SC data. Inter-impulse data are used to estimate the tonic part of the driver at 10-s intervals (tonic grid points). The tonic driver is used to compute the tonic SC (see upper row). Subtraction of the tonic part from the driver results in the phasic driver (lower row). The phasic driver shows a virtually zero baseline and distinct phasic responses.

\subsection{Measurement principles}
EDA can be measured both without externally applied voltage (endosomatic method) or with application of Direct Current (DC) or Alternating Current (AC) (exosomatic method). The widespread used method is the exosomatic with DC recordings. With direct voltage, skin resistance measurements will result when current is constant, while skin conductance measurement will result when voltage is kept constant.
\\ \indent
There are some factors that should be controlled as possible sources or variance in EDA recordings, like environmental conditions as the climatic conditions and physiological factors like age, gender and ethnic differences.
\\ \indent
EDA can be measured in many different ways electrically including skin potential, resistance, conductance, admittance, and impedance. It achieves this by passing a minuscule amount of current between two electrodes in contact with the skin. The units of measurement for conductance are microSiemens ($\mu$S).

\subsection{Recording techniques}
Electrodermal recording is usually performed with two electrodes. Exosomatic techniques use two active sites, while endosomatic recording requires an active and an inactive site.
\\
Figure \ref{fig:electrode_sites} illustrate the preferred palmar recording areas for exosomatic and endosomatic EDA recordings. Sites A and B for bipolar recordings. C and D for volar electrode sites.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Artifacts identification in EDA data}
EDA data is often captured by wearable devices, which makes the signal collected vulnerable to several types of noise. Artifacts can be generated from electronic noise or variation in the contact between the skin and the recording electrode caused by pressure, excessive movement or adjustment of the device \cite{taylor2015automatic}.
\\
They may be mistaken for a skin conductance response, and this must be avoided.
\\ \indent
Typically, as Boucsein \cite{boucsein2012electrodermal} report, the shape of an SCR typically lasts between $1a$ to $5s$, has a steep onset and an exponentially decay and reaches an amplitude of at least $0.01 \mu S$. An example of a typical SCR in figure \ref{fig:SCR_example}.
