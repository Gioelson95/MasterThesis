abstract = {In the community of music information retrieval, researchers developed methods to retrieval music with a particular melody, they also developed methods to retrieval music by similarity. We aim to retrieval music by mood, which is sometimes the exclusive manner people select music to enjoy, for example, when someone is sad for some reason, she or he wants to listen to a piece of music that can cheer her or him up, at this moment she or he will search music segment by mood no matter what the melody sounds and which the piece of music is similar to. In the essence, the difficulty for music retrieval by mood stems from the gap between the rich meanings that users want when they query and the shallowness of content descriptor we can actually compute.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Spontaneous electrodermal activity (EDA) (galvanic skin response [GSR] and skin potential response [SPR]) was recorded during daytime sleep and nighttime sleep. During all sleep, spontaneous EDA occurred most frequently during stages 3 and 4 (slow wave sleep) and least frequently during stage 1 (rapid eye movement [REM] and non-REM). This pattern was consistent over 3 nights of sleep. There was no relation between waking and sleeping spontaneous EDA. The spontaneous EDA during slow wave sleep significantly exceeded that during waking. During sleep, spontaneous SPRs often occurred without spontaneous GSRs.},

abstract = {Directional audio coding (DirAC) is a method for spatial sound representation, applicable for different sound reproduction systems. In the analysis part the diffuseness and direction of arrival of sound are estimated in a single location depending on time and frequency. In the synthesis part microphone signals are first divided into nondiffuse and diffuse parts, and are then reproduced using different strategies. DirAC is developed from an existing technology for impulse response reproduction, spatial impulse response rendering (SIRR), and imple- mentations of DirAC for different applications are described.},
